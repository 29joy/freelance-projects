This will prevent the turtles from sticking to the sheet.\nPlace whole pecans in groups of 3 on the prepared baking sheet. These will form the base for your turtles. Leave some space between each group to allow room for the caramel and chocolate.\nIf you're using soft caramels, microwave them in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the caramel is completely melted. If your caramels are very firm, you can add a splash of water or plant-based milk to help them melt more smoothly.\nIf you're making homemade caramel, follow your caramel recipe instructions until you have a smooth, melted caramel.\nSpoon a small amount of melted caramel (about 1 teaspoon) onto each cluster of pecans on the baking sheet. The caramel should slightly surround the pecans, holding them together. If necessary, use the back of the spoon to shape the caramel.\nAllow the caramel and pecans to cool and set for about 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until they are firm to the touch.\nIn a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips, stirring until smooth and fully melted.\nUsing a spoon or fork, carefully coat each caramel and pecan cluster with melted chocolate. Make sure to cover the entire caramel and pecan base. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off.\nReturn the chocolate-coated turtles to the parchment paper-lined baking sheet.\nWhile the chocolate is still soft, you can sprinkle a small pinch of sea salt on top of each turtle for a sweet and salty contrast.\nAllow the chocolate turtles to cool at room temperature until the chocolate is fully set, which may take 1 to 2 hours. You can also place them in the refrigerator for faster setting.\nOnce the chocolate is set, carefully remove the chocolate turtles from the parchment paper and transfer them to an airtight container. Store them at room temperature or in the refrigerator, depending on your preference.\nNotes:\nIn sticking with our real food philosophy, we recommend\nSweet Apricity Caramels\nUse a piece of parchment paper or silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.\nAllow the chocolate turtles to fully set before touching them.\nStore at room temperature or in the fridge for up to 1 week.\nCheck out all of our\nKitchen Favorites\nNutrition Facts\nNutrition Facts\nChocolate Turtles\nAmount Per Serving\nCalories\n198\nCalories from Fat 90\n% Daily Value*\nFat\n10g\n15%\nSaturated Fat 4g\n25%\nPolyunsaturated Fat 2g\nMonounsaturated Fat 2g\nCholesterol\n2mg\n1%\nSodium\n54mg\n2%\nPotassium\n113mg\n3%\nCarbohydrates\n29g\n10%\nFiber 0.4g\n2%\nSugar 24g\n27%\nProtein\n1g\n2%\nVitamin A\n12IU\n0%\nVitamin C\n0.1mg\n0%\nCalcium\n46mg\n5%\nIron\n0.1mg\n1%\nPercent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.", "meta": {"data_info": {"lang": "en", "url": "https://www.100daysofrealfood.com/chocolate-turtles/", "source": "100daysofrealfood.com", "type": "Recipe/HowTo", "processing_date": "2025-09-14", "delivery_version": "V1.0", "title": "Chocolate Turtles", "content": "[Image: https://www.100daysofrealfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6290c-scaled.jpg]\nIngredients:\n24\npecan halves\n¾\ncup\nsoft caramels*\n(store-bought or homemade)\n¾\ncup\nchocolate chips\nsea salt\n(optional, for sprinkling)\nInstructions:\nFirst, line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
